# pulls

A menubar application for managing pull requests, similar to what <a href="https://github.com/pulls">github.com/pulls</a> provides, but with a few added extras:

- Custom pre-defined queries for the data you care about (supports anything that github's search syntax supports)
- Folders for organizing in progress work
